# SPOT: Sentiment Polarity Annotations Dataset

The SPOT dataset contains 197 reviews originating from the Yelp'13 [1] and IMDB [2] collections,
annotated with segment-level polarity labels. Annotations have been gathered on 2 levels of 
granulatiry:

 - Sentences
 - Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs)

This dataset is intended to aid sentiment analysis research and, in particular, the evaluation of
methods that attempt to perform finer-grained sentiment analysis.
