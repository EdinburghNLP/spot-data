-	Really ?????? <s>

-	I really hate to do this ,
0	because i have been a fan of the merc bar for years ,
0	but its a must . <s>
0	My fiance & i were looking for a place
0	to entertain our wedding party the weekend before our wedding
0	and it was clear to us

+	We love the atmpsphere . <s>
+	It usually has a nice & mature crowd . <s>
+	The service is usually good . <s>
+	It was perfect . <s>
-	Unfortunately , it was the management and not the lounge

-	The manager ( tommy ) was slow/nearly impossible to reach and even harder to get info out of ...
0	i.e. whats your process for group reservations . <s>
-	He seemed annoyed

-	After several incomplete emails he finally called me , at my request ,
0	but it became clear , after 5 mins on the phone ,

0	It was also apparent

0	Since , the goal of the evening is relax & enjoy our time with our friends ,
-	not to worry about bad service ,
0	we took our covo with tommy as a hint

0	" Second thought was " well the foods not great , not good , but not bad . <s>
0	" This would have been a two star rating . <s>

0	Over the years i 've stopped by now and then to see

-	Nope , still the same boring burgers . <s>
-	Char-broiling a burger over an open flame just does n't do it for me . <s>
-	It always results in a dry , bland burger . <s>
-	Mesquite or no ,
-	it does n't really make much difference

-	And it does n't help much
-	to pile on a bunch of junk from the condiment/topping bar

-	I 'd much rather have a burger
0	cooked on a flat griddle-surface

0	Now vietnamese restaurants are n't known for their service

+	I still like to shop here

-	One issue is

0	And i should mention

0	Add to all of that -

0	This is the kind of place

0	I wanted to like this place , i really did . <s>

0	and feels

+	I love the old tempe style tall brick walls and the clean interior design . <s>
+	We were greeted with a friendly smile and a " no worries " from our waitress . <s>
-	However , at that point , it went downhill so fast . <s>
0	First off ,
0	we ordered a couple of latte 's ,
-	and found them to be lukewarm instead of hot ( plus ,
-	they were all foam ,
-	which means the barman was having trouble with the difference between capuccino 's and latte 's ) . <s>
+	They remade them
+	and we set about having a good time once again . <s>

-	Forever to get the food . <s>
-	Forever to get the bill . <s>
-	Just absolutely terrible service . <s>
0	Meanwhile ,

-	We had a very disappointing experience today at over easy . <s>
-	First of all , the service was lousy , slow and inattentive . <s>
-	We had to remind the waiter
-	twice to bring drinks and once to bring toast
-	that came with my father 's meal . <s>
-	The food was equally unremarkable :
-	i had the cheddar biscuits and gravy
-	and they were bland , barely seasoned and cold . <s>
0	My husband had the famed " waffle dogs "
0	and he said
0	they were " decent , "
0	but that 's about it . <s>
0	Our friend had the chicken fried steak
0	and found
-	it lacked seasoning ,
-	and the breading was sliding off of the meat . <s>
0	She said
+	the hash browns were the best part of the plate ,
0	giving them " three stars . <s>
-	" Overall , we will never come back to over easy again due to the service and bland , average food . <s>

1 0306769
0	I will keep this one short . <s>

0	to eat after golf
0	and since this is in my neighborhood was hoping for it
0	to be good . <s>
-	They seemed understaffed . <s>
0	I ordered the chicken salad with raspberry viniagrette . <s>
0	The salad came with ice berg lettuce ,

-	It was not very good . <s>
0	My husband ordered a hot dog and fries . <s>
0	He said

0	and fries fine . <s>
0	But

0	My salad was $ 8 . <s>

0	Go for fish over lobster or shrimp ,

+	and it tastes good
+	going down . <s>
+	Plus , salsa bar ! <s>
+	They 've added dessert ,
+	and the coconut-lime bars are really good . <s>
-	Not so good is the sangria ,
-	which has a strange cardboard background taste . <s>
-	Why two stars ? <s>
-	Well , it does n't taste so good
0	coming back up . <s>
0	Five hours later , it all did ,
-	and the problem lasted for 24 hours . <s>

2 0307825

+	The food was good ,

0	I had the pierogis
0	while my friend had swedish meatballs . <s>
+	Both dishes were tasty ,

0	One thing
-	that was disappointing was

0	I saw online

0	I think

-	The one down thing for the lunch is

-	Instead of a meal she ordered just a side of asparagus -
-	and 6 stalks were $ 5.75 . <s>
+	It is brushed with oil and grilled . <s>
0	She claimed
+	it was very good ,
-	but at about $ 1 per piece , i do n't know
-	if it could be that good ...
+	my entire salad was $ 8.75 ...
+	the service was fast and friendly . <s>

0	I have to agree with both pierre
0	and donald . <s>

+	The lettuce wedge and the willy burger . <s>
-	The steaks are awful ! <s>
-	They put some crap

0	I know
0	i know
0	that is a big difference

0	We 've come too far as a dining public

-	Also , the " sonoran dog " was less sonora and more hippie haberdashery . <s>
+	Both items , the fish taco and hot dog , were decent . <s>

0	So we figured with previews
0	we 'd be fine ,

0	Upon entering the theatre ,
0	we realize

-	We went back to guest services

0	After a moment

0	we asked

0	I had a very mixed experience at the stand . <s>
+	The burger and fries were good . <s>
+	The chocolate shake was divine : rich and creamy . <s>
-	The drive-thru was horrible . <s>
-	It took us at least 30 minutes
-	to order and get our food
0	when there were only four cars in front of us . <s>
0	I can understand how drive-thrus can get backed up . <s>
0	It happens . <s>
-	All the worker had to do
-	was apologize for the wait
0	when we got our food . <s>
-	We complained about the wait
-	and we got a half hearted apology . <s>
+	I would like to go back
+	because the food is good
+	and i want to support a local business . <s>
-	My only hesitation is the long wait . <s>
-	It is hard to wait that long in a drive - thru . <s>

0	Went for sunday brunch after morning rains
-	so the patio was closed . <s>
-	They should switch entrances
-	so the restaurant comes before the market . <s>
-	Kinda confusing for the first time visitor . <s>
+	The restaurant itself is very nicely decorated with a classy feel . <s>
+	It 's a varied clientele : i noticed tables
+	that could 've been from the golden girls to real housewives of scottdale to teen mom , az . <s>
0	. <s>
0	I thought
0	the food ,
0	while good , was not anything spectacular . <s>
-	Portions were pretty small for the price
-	and there was not much by way of presentation
-	to match the tag . <s>
-	My sangria seemed a bit diluted . <s>
-	Our waiter was being trained
-	so i 'll pardon his awkwardness
-	as he tried to repeat everything
-	he was supposed to memorize multiple times . <s>
+	I 'd come back on a cool day
0	to try hh out on the patio to people watch ,
-	but probably not for brunch . <s>

0	Came here last week with my $ 10 for $ 20 groupon . <s>
-	Their menu is a little uninspired with the standard sandwich items
-	and a tiny bag of lay 's come with the sandwiches . <s>
-	All the other chips options
-	they have are extra . <s>
0	For two sandwiches , two orders of soup and one tea , i think
-	we ended up at about $ 26 . <s>
0	Glad i had that groupon . <s>
-	My sandwich was just okay . <s>
-	Exactly what i could make at home
-	so i was a bit disappointed . <s>
0	I tried the broccoli cheese soup
0	and it was n't bad , not great
-	and i probably would n't get it again . <s>
0	While you could tell
0	it was a locally owned and decorated place ,
+	it was cute
-	but i did n't really like sitting at patio furniture inside . <s>
0	Personal preference i guess . <s>
-	Since nothing wow 'd me
-	and it was a bit on the pricey side ,
-	i probably would n't come back . <s>
0	Sorry ladybug . <s>

0	Incredibly odd layout to this place . <s>
0	I needed a few minutes and a rosetta stone to figure out
0	why there needs to be segregated dining . <s>
0	Still a mystery . <s>
+	The food is pretty good . <s>
0	I echo the overall sentiment about the authenticity . <s>
+	But they 've done a decent job
+	of melding the upper east side with the southwest . <s>
0	One thing
-	they should have left on manhattan

-	Because customer service matters in the rest of the world . <s>

+	Love this neighborhood spot . <s>

0	Made with fried wonton chips ,
0	crumbled italian sausage , pepperoni slices , peppers , and melted cheese . <s>

0	I was introduced to five guys burgers during one of my many trips up to chandler blvd. . <s>
0	. <s>
0	The burgers come in two sizes , a double and a single . <s>
+	All of the toppings are free
+	and the options are plentiful . <s>
+	The soda machines are the new touch screen type with lots of different flavors . <s>
+	The burgers are always juicy and delicious although i could stand
-	for them to be a little bigger . <s>
0	The real reason
+	why i will continue to return
+	are the fries . <s>
+	Omg these are probably the best fries
+	i 've had
0	since i had thrasher 's fries on the boardwalk of ocean city md. . <s>
0	. <s>
0	If you put ketchup on these fries you
0	are missing the point entirely . <s>
0	Vinegar is provided on the condiment table
+	and takes the fries to the next level . <s>
+	As a word of advice , the small order of fries is more than enough for two people . <s>
0	Save your money
0	and share a small order . <s>
-	This brings me to the only real negative ... the prices . <s>
0	I am aware
0	that
0	if you want a quality burger
0	you will pay for it ,
-	but when my wife and i get a burger each , a small fry to share and two drinks
-	and it comes to 20 dollars ,
-	something is wrong . <s>
-	I 'm never full
-	when i leave
-	and it seems
-	like i should be after spending 20 bucks for lunch . <s>
+	Definitely worth checking out
0	though if you 're a burger/fries fan . <s>

0	I 'm torn on 4 or 3 stars . <s>
0	I thought

0	They bring you 3 types of salsa . <s>
+	We arrived to a really good 2 person band
0	performing on thursday night . <s>
+	Its just a nice place to hang out . <s>
0	I would have to rate
-	it was expensive . <s>
0	I had the seafood guac . <s>

0	I probably would have given it 3 stars

+	Great place for going to the movies . <s>
+	I like this place for a lot of reasons , here are some of them ... 1 . <s>
+	Clean , no smells , my feet never stick to the floor 2 . <s>
+	I feel safe there and in the parking lot 3 . <s>
+	The people that work there seem to understand what i am saying 4 . <s>

+	I can eat an okay dinner
+	and get to the movie ( baja fresh , panda express , wildflower bread co. , claim jumper etc ) 6 . <s>
+	They never freak
+	when i bring a drink from another place 7 . <s>
+	My friends can find the place easily 8 . <s>
+	Rarely packed out even for brand new releases <s>

3 0314548
0	I would probably give this place 3.5 stars . <s>
0	I am rounding up to 4 stars
+	because the prices are much more reasonable
0	that other " dinner movie theaters . <s>
+	" Also , the service is friendly and fast ,
+	and the menu options are pretty good . <s>
+	The food also seems a bit cheaper than other similar places . <s>
-	The food however is n't amazing . <s>
+	It seems to be slightly better than other places
0	we have been to ,
+	and they are somewhat generous with their portions . <s>
0	While some of the seating is more normal ,
0	regular chairs , there are also seating options
0	that are office chairs . <s>
+	They are comfortable ones ,
-	but at times it can be a bit awkward
0	when you swivel into your neighbor
0	or try to get comfortable . <s>
0	I will continue to go here though for this type of experience ,
+	as the prices are so reasonable . <s>
+	It 's also very clean ! <s>

3 0315233
+	Yum !! <s>
+	What a cool place !! <s>
+	The wine list is great

0	Is n't that funny ? <s>
0	What 's funnier is
0	that i went here with some guy i
0	married for our wedding night dinner ! <s>
0	Ha-ha !
+	* the food is very delicious
+	and the women that work here are uncontrollably adorable , always . <s>
+	It 's a little dream of a house
0	and takes you a bit out of the city
0	when you 're here . * back story :
0	i married some bulgarian
0	so he could get citizenship . <s>
0	It did n't work out ,
0	so we are d-i-v-o-r-c-e-d . <s>
0	At the ripe young age of 24 , too ! <s>
0	My grandkids are going to have a field day with me . <s>

3 0315821
0	This particular location is n't as busy as the location in tempe . <s>
0	Why that is ,
0	i am not sure
0	considering it is sitting across the street from the mall . <s>
+	Over all the food and service is very good . <s>
+	Very attentive and food is huge ! <s>
+	No matter what you order , it 's tough to finish . <s>
+	Bakery has a lot
0	to offer anyone
0	who comes in . <s>
+	Bagels are fresh in the morning ,
0	but i would not recommend purchasing after 11am . <s>
+	The cream cheese is awesome ,
0	which we brought home tonight . <s>

3 0315893
0	I 'm not a huge greek fan ,
0	probably because i do n't like lamb gyros or pitas or
0	whatever they want to call it . <s>
0	But today i went in just get a chicken pita . <s>
0	I thought
0	it would be like any other chicken pita
0	but i was wrong . <s>
+	The chicken was very moist and the flavor was damn good . <s>
+	There sauce actually had good flavor to it since other places
0	i 've had we 're very bland . <s>
0	My friend got the chicken kabob plate ,
+	which for 8.99 was huge . <s>
+	He got a salad then a huge thing of rice , huge chunks of chicken and some toasted pita bread . <s>
+	Well worth it ,
+	this thing could probably feed 2 people . <s>
0	The rice
+	they have
+	is great
+	and the pitas were not over cooked/toasted . <s>
0	The only draw back is during lunch
-	it can get cramped in there
-	and the pepsi seemed alittle sweeter
0	than it should be . <s>
0	But those are very small problems . <s>
+	I would come back again
+	when i 'm in the area . <s>

0	Went late ,

0	but thought what the heck ,
0	lets get some of that claim jumper going . <s>
+	Very clean with wide open feel to it . <s>
+	Nice lighting and greeted right away

+	The food was decent comfort food . <s>
+	Huge portions as others have noted . <s>
0	I had the rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes

+	They have a good selection of beer on tap

+	I really really really like the personality of this " newly "
+	discovered place . <s>
+	The evening temps allowed us to sit and enjoy on the patio . <s>
0	The owner ? <s>
+	Greeted us
+	and had a conversation with our dinner companions
+	since they both lived/worked in maryland at one point ,
+	demonstrating to me at least ,
+	that he seemed sincerely interested in his clientele . <s>
+	We shared
0	a crab dip app and i thought
+	it was rich , creamy and delicious . <s>
-	But the problem
-	with sharing an app with some folks is no one likes
-	to take the last few bites ,
+	so i wound eating alot of it . <s>
0	I ordered the green chile sauce pasta , however ,
-	i was a little disappointed
-	that there was not much green chile flavor/kick to the dish
0	( i 'm aware
0	that not all green chile 's are fiery hot ) . <s>
+	My wife 's dish , the baramundi special , was much better , albeit a tad heavy on the rice . <s>
+	I also ordered a cup of clam chowder ,
-	but had it sent back
-	because it had bacon in it . <s>
-	I do n't think
-	clam chowder has bacon in it . <s>
+	We were comp
0	'd a mixed berry " cobbler " desert
-	since a side salad
-	that was ordered was not brought out . <s>
-	It was a huge desert , but rather cakey , and more like a berry shortcake than a cobbler . <s>
+	Overall , a nice little place with a great atmosphere . <s>
+	Excellent service and staff . <s>
+	Many seafood options for non-meat eaters . <s>

3 0318569
+	Coffee tastes great . <s>
-	Service was a little questionable . <s>
0	I do n't mind having to wait a bit for coffee -
0	i understand
0	that quality takes time . <s>
0	But i think
-	it would help to have more than one person
0	making the drinks on a saturday morning . <s>
-	I waited in a line with about 6 people in front of me
-	and did n't have my drink until 20 minutes later . <s>
-	Also , the drink was wrong . <s>
0	I ordered a hot salted caramel latte
-	and ended up with an iced regular caramel latte -
-	and yes , it was definitely my order . <s>
0	I drank it anyway
+	and it was pretty good . <s>
0	I went back later to give it a second chance
0	and finally got my salted caramel latte . <s>
+	It was amazing ...
0	i added a sprinkle of cinnamon
+	and it was a glorious fall beverage . <s>
+	Also , the price was reasonable -
+	i love
0	that they do n't add tax . <s>
+	I recommend this place ,
0	but make sure
0	they take your order correctly . <s>

0	Their full menu is organized into sections : smalls , bites , ocean , ranch , farm , greens , ands . <s>
+	Everything looks and sounds great
-	although unfortunately for those of us

0	My friend and i had gone to az this past weekend for spring training
0	to see the angels play . <s>
0	After their game we went on a mission
0	to find a place for dinner (
0	yes it was early ,

+	The food came out pretty quick
+	so that was a plus for our ravenous tummies . <s>
+	My tacos were pretty legit . <s>
+	It came with a side of chips and salsa ;
-	the salsa i 'll pass on ( tasted like pace bottled salsa )
+	but the chips were n't bad . <s>
+	My friend 's buffalo strips were hands down some of the best buffalo chicken
+	i have ever tried . <s>
0	I do n't know
0	what they did
+	but it was the most tender melt-in-your-mouth chicken . <s>
0	I almost wished
0	i had

0	Our bill came out to $ 17something in the end for 2 entrees and 1 soda

3 0318862
-	This location is in a scary neighborhood . <s>

0	Do n't let the location or decor steer you away ,

0	The cup

0	If you 've only been to papadeaux 's or baby kay 's you will find
0	that the food is different . <s>
+	That 's because flavors is authentic

0	You can only compare it to actually authentic cajun restaurants in south louisiana . <s>
