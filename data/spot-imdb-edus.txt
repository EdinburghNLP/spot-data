0	that is the newer episodes . <s>
-	Spongebob has been downgraded and turned into a mindless whining ,
-	idiotic voice is now a lot more high-pitched . <s>
-	The plots , animation and dialogue show no effort whatsoever . ( i think

-	of how nickelodeon has sealed its own grave ,
-	ruining their greatest shows

0	If you 're going to judge this show ,
0	judge it by older seasons 1 through 3 , not the current episodes ,

+	Queen latifah has proved herself to be a fairly good actress ,
0	but one has to wonder
0	why she was cast in this ? <s>
-	Instead of giving her character witty and smart dialog ,

0	Aside from lance henriksen and tim thomerson ,
-	the acting is pretty much dreadful . <s>
+	The plot is actually reasonable ,

-	The direction is ridiculously amateur ,
-	turning every scene with action
-	that could potentially be good into a blurry non-event . <s>
-	Most heinous of all is the underuse of the sasquatch ,
-	which makes this barely even classifiable as a creature feature . <s>
+	The sasquatch is certainly the most likable character ,
-	since it does n't have to utter any rubbish dialogue
-	and manages to bump off a few of the cast members . <s>
+	Even though it looks like it wandered onto the set from a completely different movie , its still a likable

-	Still , it does n't provide any reason

0	The general message of this video is
0	that it 's extremely difficult and physically demanding
0	to be a dancer . <s>
0	This is an idea
0	that was probably absorbed by the dance public quite a while ago
0	and i , for one , am not anxious to hear it again . <s>
-	And yet , this video drums it into our heads repeatedly
0	while showing the brutality of the " etoile " ( star ) survival-of-the-fittest system . <s>
-	I also fail to see why so much is made of bejart 's work . <s>
-	And especially since the " ninth symphony " , admittedly not a ballet but more of a " circus " in my opinion ,
0	is set to beethoven 's music . <s>
-	For some reason , beethoven , for all his greatness , seems to be one of the least danceable composers
0	to ever be choreographed . <s>
0	Maybe his actual ballet music like " the creatures of prometheus " might be done more successfully . <s>
0	To me ,

0	I found this video

0	No doubt it would be of greater interest to dancers and ballet fans .

0	that it shows
0	how people sacrifice their lives for the sake of others ,
0	even if it means giving up their comfortable lives to do so . <s>
-	Nor do i like it for the rather overblown and melodramatic relationship between the main characters . <s>
+	Why i like this movie is the fact

0	Jolie 's character 's morality in beyond borders is something
0	one can debate about . <s>

0	This movie is a remake of " the omega man " rather than an adaption of the book " i am legend " . <s>
-	Francis lawrence 's movie does n't share much more with richard matheson 's classic novel than the title . <s>
-	It still could have turned out to be an entertaining popcorn flick ,
0	but " i am legend "
-	is n't even that . <s>
-	The pacing is incredibly slow at times ,

+	Watching will smith wander through an abandoned new york is cool at first ,

-	The creatures are another disappointed . <s>
-	Bad plus some rather conventional voice effects by mike patton just do n't make for very frightening zombies . <s>
-	And finally , the ending is so unexciting and dull one leaves the theatre ( or turns out the tv

0	Here 's an idea :

0	It is officially out and should be easy to find

0	It 's an independent
0	and it shows but not on the effects . <s>
0	It only shows on the amount of actors and on the way
0	the script was written . <s>
0	There are a few cgi shots
0	but it 's only the apocalypse of berlin
+	and it worked out fine . <s>
0	The zombies itself are okay in the way
0	they act

0	But overall it 's more a love story than a real zombie flick . <s>
0	Nevertheless , the zombies do appear at regular base
0	just when you think

0	There is a bit of red stuff
0	and only in the beginning there is a bite in the neck

0	" la bimba di satana " by mario bianchi is actually a remake of andrea bianchi 's supremely sleazy " malabimba " . <s>
0	It was shot as a hard core sex feature from the outset . <s>
0	There is plenty of explicit sex , perversity and full-frontal nudity in this lovely piece of italian smut . <s>
0	The role of the innocent nun
0	who is thrown into nightmare of possession plays again mariangela giordano , famous from " burial ground " and " giallo a venezia " . <s>
0	There is also a little bit of zombie action ,
-	unfortunately the complete pornographic version of this piece of sleaze is probably lost forever . <s>
0	Still if you enjoyed " malabimba "
+	you ca n't go wrong with " la bimba di satana " . <s>
+	The story of possessed miria is just so wonderfully murky and sleazy

0	Alien factor , the director 's first movie , seemed to me

0	It seems to me
0	that with fiend writer/director , don dohler realized

0	it should be noted

0	A nightmare on elm street is probably the second biggest reference in the world of modern horror movies - alongside with the exorcist . <s>

0	if you are n't an usual viewer of horror movies . <s>
0	This is the first of many sequels
0	and i must say
0	that it is ,

0	First of all let

0	the things

0	It does n't matter

0	The idea of basing a movie on walt whitman 's visit a restrictive , narrow-minded community in southern ontario

0	The movie is about the kind

0	The acting - especially by rip

0	Most hollywood made films

0	after chasing her . <s>
0	She attempted suicide

0	I am confused as to why so many people seem to hate this movie . <s>
+	Its easily the best comedy jim carey was ever in . <s>
0	I guess his fans (
-	and the critics ) were n't just ready for this likable performer
0	known for his simplistic gross-out comedies
0	to play a full-blown psychopath . <s>
+	" the cable guy " is a zany comedy ,
+	but is also a very dark one with some subversive
0	messages included . <s>
+	In my mind , it works much better
+	than the films is spoofs such as " the hand
+	that rocks the cradle " and " single white female " . <s>
+	The acting all around is very good . <s>
-	Matthew broderick is a bit on the bland side ,
-	but makes for a likable and sympathetic protagonist . <s>
-	He is overshadowed by carey though . <s>
0	Carey 's character is annoying ,
+	but many people did n't understand
+	he was meant to be . <s>
0	He is also revealed to be an unnerving psychopath in the final third of the film . <s>
-	Some have complained
0	that the last third (
-	in which things take a turn for the seriously dark )
-	does n't mesh well with the first two-thirds
0	which are more comedic
-	and slapstick ( albiet of a twisted nature ) . <s>
-	I disagree strongly . <s>
-	The one main flaw with the film is
0	that i wish
-	they had explored carey 's character more than just the explanation
-	of him having no parents to raise him and just the tv set . <s>
+	Aside from it being well made ,
+	it is hilarious ,
0	which is the main thing
+	most people are looking for .

0	My initial thoughts of this film is
-	that it would be silly and cringey . <s>
0	But i was wrong . <s>
0	The thing
0	that made it for me
0	was the character focus on max . <s>
0	Right from the start we see max in the opening sequence right till the end . <s>
0	It did n't feel
0	like the focus was ever lifted from him
+	as the film was all about following max on this special journey
0	and i feel
0	like we did . <s>
0	The actor
0	who played

0	thought
0	he would be . <s>
+	I loved the huge monsters ,

+	The ending was good
0	as you could feel
0	what it was trying to convey
0	but i would have

0	That 's the thing about this film ,

+	' knocked-up ' was far better
0	than i had hoped . <s>
-	I was not impress with the '40 year-old virgin ' or ' superbad '

-	' knocked-up ' in stark contrast still maintains the adolescence humor of '40 year-old virgin ' or ' superbad '
+	but is far more intelligent and witty ,
+	bordering at times on comedic brilliance . <s>
+	It is also able to match the comedy with a sincere thread throughout ,
0	which is hard to achieve . <s>
+	Seth rogen is great as the expectant father ,
0	i am unsure
0	how much of the script was improvised
+	but there were many moments of laugh-out-loud originality ,
+	the whole cast delivers on the acting front . <s>
-	At times the jokes can be a little too crude ,
+	but overall they are well managed . <s>
+	Special mention to the scene in the las vegas hotel between rogen and paul rudd ,
0	high on mushrooms their interplay is spot-on
0	and it is moments like this
+	which make it memorable . <s>
-	The one criticism i do have is the last 30 minutes ,
-	the gags do not seem to work as well due to the more serious tone , and the film lumbers a little . <s>
+	I respect
+	that the film wanted to make an emotional punch at the end

0	While subdued and a little slow-moving ,

0	The fact
0	that his act would be difficult to ever prove or prosecute
0	only makes things worse in many ways for rory jansen . <s>
+	The various additional elements of suspense and romance help to create a unique combination . <s>
+	Interesting :

0	The acting ranges from tepid to quite good . <s>

0	to freeze-frame and read the rejection letters

0	the words ends ,

0	Along with " the old man "

0	Anyone with interests in fiction writing , the publishing industry ,

0	Interestingly , i would n't really call it remake
0	considering over 55 % of this short consists of old footage . <s>
0	I understand
0	that columbia pictures had downsized the short subjects unit ,
-	but i do n't understand
-	why they had to remake a lot of shorts
0	that were basically only a few years old . <s>
-	Every single stooge short from that was a remake was a remake of a short with shemp . <s>
-	Why could n't they have remade a short from the curly era ? <s>
+	This is not a terrible short , i mean
+	that it is good ,
-	but it is not at as good as the original . <s>
+	I 'll give this a rating of eight stars out of ten , eight
0	for being something
+	that made me laugh . <s>
+	So in short , it is somewhat unoriginal but still entertaining to watch . <s>
0	If you are a fan of the three stooges ,

+	Midsomer murders is an excellent murder detective series . <s>
+	It is my second favorite behind agatha christie 's poirot and marple . <s>
+	The setting and the actors are great . <s>
+	I really enjoy watching midsomer murders
0	and it really makes
0	you think
+	( which is what i love about detective shows ) . <s>
+	This show is one of my favorite british tv shows . <s>
+	And i personally prefer british crime shows than the american ones (
0	even though in general i prefer american tv shows ) . <s>
0	The show is basically about two detectives ( tom barnaby and gavin troy )
0	who solve murders
0	that happen in the county of midsomer . <s>
0	Currently there have been 11 seasons
+	but the show definitely does not get old . <s>
0	For anyone
+	who enjoys a good detective and crime show , this is definitely worth a try . <s>
+	It is very enjoyable and exciting .

0	Everyone takes this movie so seriously . <s>
0	There is indeed serious content . <s>
0	Malena defines '
0	beauty is a curse ' . <s>
+	She drives all the men wild with lust ,
0	while the the other women
-	( almost all are unattractive
-	) fill themselves with undisguised hate . <s>
-	These forces put malena on a nasty little path
0	in which she has almost no choice . <s>
+	The town women ultimately have their day ,
-	and were very cruel . <s>
0	As a man i can see
0	why she would drive you nuts , though . <s>
0	But it is the boy
+	that makes it all work . <s>
+	I lmao sometimes at his little antics and responses to the nastiness
+	that he spied going on around his fantasy love malena . <s>
+	Also his fantasies with her are great , probably like some of the silly stuff
0	i imagined
0	when i was a kid . <s>
+	Its worth watching even with subtitles . <s>
0	After a while you can almost follow the story
0	without them .

0	I 'm sorry ...
0	you look so familiar . <s>
0	Have n't we met before , somewhere ? <s>
0	That sounds like a tired pickup line ,
0	but it is significant to this movie in a way
-	that can not be explained
0	without giving away the plot . <s>
0	I watched this to see rie rasmussen 's ( angel-a ) debut film . <s>
0	She had a small role ,
0	but oh , so ,
+	delicious to watch ! <s>
0	This was rebecca romijn 's and antonio banderas ' film ,
+	and they did a great job
+	of keeping me interested throughout . <s>
+	But , it is really brian de palma 's film . <s>
+	A neo-noir masterpiece that was so deep on so many levels
+	that it could be a whole semester in film school . <s>
+	It all seemed so simple ,
0	but that is the deception
+	that de palma uses to drag you in
0	before he blows you away . <s>
+	It is an homage to so many great films and great directors , notably hitchcock . <s>
+	If you love film ,
0	it is one
+	you should not miss . <s>
0	If nothing else ,
+	there is rie rasmussen

0	If there is one word
0	that could describe is quiet little movie ,
+	it would be charming . <s>
+	Almost everyone in this movie is simply so polite and pleasing . <s>
0	Set in the first decade of the past century ,
0	this movie is the life story of beatrix potter , the author of the children 's classic " tales of peter rabbit " . <s>
0	However , the lead character was played by american renee zellweger ,
+	who after the bridget jones films , have really gotten her englishwoman act down pat . <s>
+	She is very convincing and
0	involving in her portrayal ,
0	you would n't think
0	she was from texas ! <s>
0	Miss potter had a very personal and intimate relationship with her animal " friends " ,
+	and this was shown very creatively in the subtle animation of these characters
0	coming alive in her eyes . <s>
0	This is also a story of her love affair with her publisher norman warne ,
+	so nicely played by a very versatile ewan mcgregor . <s>
+	He played innocent and romantic so well ,
0	you would not believe
0	he was the same actor from " trainspotting " ! <s>
+	It is very enjoyable to watch and well worth
0	the time spent . <s>
+	This was very pleasant break from the consecutive violent movies
0	i have seen recently .

0	Quinn is in a pinch . <s>
0	She is overbooked with dates
0	( as usual )
0	and can not babysit for a family . <s>
0	In a pinch , she bribes daria to do it for her --
0	who is n't eager
0	considering that she knows nothing about kids and is a bit scared of them . <s>
0	This turns out to be prophetic , as the family

+	Imtiaz ali did a very good job both in the concept and the direction . <s>
-	It is not often hard to find editing or concept flaws in hindi movies . <s>
-	This one surely was an odd case . <s>
0	Many instances one would feel
-	that karina 's character was over acted
-	and some qualities exaggerated
+	but in fact the story * is * about a character that odd . <s>
+	It 's a fun-filled movie . <s>
+	Some jokes , some situations and most characters fit in well with the story . <s>
+	If you are kind

+	then this is for you . <s>
0	Also ,
+	if you like movies

+	then this is for you . <s>
+	If you are the kind
+	who like family oriented movies with a touch of indian culture ,
+	then this is for you . <s>
+	It 's worth

0	It seems like a lot of the really old movies i see ,
0	( pre 1950 ) are a little boring . <s>
-	The pace usually drags ,
-	the conclusion is usually bland , especially
0	compared to newer , more edgy films ,
-	and the dialog is strange . <s>
0	Remnants of years
0	gone by are all over this film ,
+	but it fails to bore you for a second . <s>
+	It is engaging

0	When he comes to visit ,
0	a young girl starts to think
0	that her uncle may be a serial killer of wealthy women . <s>
0	She finds clues
0	and she is torn between her love for him and her morals . <s>
+	I really enjoyed this movie , maybe my favorite hitchcock so far besides " rear window . <s>
0	" The only thing
-	i did n't like
-	was the strange relationship between the girl and the detective ...
0	i thought
-	that was awkward . <s>
-	She seems way too young for him . 9 out of 10 , kids . 

8 0316030
-	My only criticism of this film has to do with the musical score . <s>
+	The opening theme is lovely . <s>
-	However , throughout the film there are ridiculous and loud crashes of dramatic music
-	to punctuate scenes
-	that are not particularly dramatic . <s>
0	For instance , early in the film the brother " trippy " stomps off to his room in a petulant rage
-	leaving bette in the hallway . <s>
-	There 's a huge burst of melodramatic orchestral music
-	that causes one to search for the mute button frantically . <s>
0	Based on the music ,
0	you 'd think
0	that trippy is in his room
-	shooting himself in the head or at least throwing all his belongings into a suitcase , but no . <s>
0	When bette rushes into his room ,
0	he 's just sitting in the chair
0	looking overcome . <s>
-	The music portended nothing
-	and was just plain silly and loud . <s>
-	The music notwithstanding ,
+	mr. skeffington is one of my favorite films . <s>
+	Claude rains was a fantastic actor with a very attractive voice . <s>
0	I wish
+	more of his films were available on dvd . <s>
0	I 'm not usually a fan of melodramas
+	but mr. skeffington has more humorous lines and scenes
0	than the plot summary might indicate .

0	Saw this movie
0	when i was very young
+	and was charmed . <s>
+	I now watch it every easter season and still remained as coddled
0	and cuddled by it
0	as i was as a child . <s>
+	It 's delightful . <s>
+	It is also a beautiful example of ballet and cinema . <s>
+	It boast some of the most beautiful photography
0	to come out of england to date ,
0	which is no small feat
+	considering that english cinematographers are amongst the very skilled and best . <s>
+	The sets , costumes and critter make-up is also equally accomplished . <s>
0	With so many young people
+	lacking in any traditional culture or understanding of the arts , this is a perfect way
+	to expose them to something other than most of the mindless entertainment
0	that targets them . <s>
+	At least kids will learn something here about the history of the arts and culture . <s>
+	Anything is better
0	than bringing them up on moronic commercial jingles and shows
0	that are always
0	tied into merchandising . <s>
0	Or pumping them up on video games that
+	teach them nothing more than mindless winning and competition . <s>
+	Not to mention this is a very good understanding of potter 's early life
+	and how she became inspired to draw . <s>
+	It 's probably a better interpretation than the mushed down , saturday morning cartoon interpretation with renee zellwigger . <s>
0	If you are tired of your kids

0	This is the gateway

0	Children

+	Second - for all those that love a quality story ,
+	this is the grand-daddy of them all for modern times . <s>
+	Sure the story is told from a more artistic viewpoint
0	than the book is ,
+	but that just adds to the enjoyment . * read the book . <s>
+	Third - since the current ( wonderful ) movies are coming out ,
+	this provides a foundation

0	Finally -
0	even in this animated version , one can tell

0	Boy was i wrong . <s>
+	It starts off with great dialogue

+	The characters were fun
+	but also very serious and believable . <s>
+	Clint eastwood and morgan freeman had some funny moments together

0	considering the rest of the movie was a hard drama . <s>

-	Yes , this movie has a bit of " the omega man " and " the last man on earth " in it ,
+	but for the most part it is its own movie . <s>
0	It starts out with the world in ruins , well new york in ruins
0	and you are
0	introduced to robert neville
0	who may be the last man on earth . <s>
0	You are also introduced to sam his faithful german shepard ,
+	which struck a chord with me as i
+	used to own one of those myself
+	and love that particular breed . <s>
0	You get to see how he spends a typical day in his life
0	and you also are introduced to those things
0	that lurk in the darkness
0	and only come out at night . <s>
0	However , at this stage those
0	that come out at night seem to be targeting our hero . <s>
+	So we have some good chase scenes , and some good action ,
-	but you also have a couple of scenes
-	that are really depressing especially
0	if you like dogs . <s>
0	Our hero is not alone for the entire picture , however ,
0	as he comes across a lady and her son , well they kind of come across him . <s>
0	There are also flashbacks
0	detailing the beginning of the end of civilization . <s>
0	The creatures are different than those in omega man and last man
0	too as they are more like that
0	infected from 28 days later
0	though they do share the pale traits of the omega ones . <s>
+	All in all a good movie

+	This is just a movie

0	The part of the film

+	Overall at first he has a lot of rage with them
+	but later saved them
-	by killing himself . <s>
0	The outburst
0	he had
0	where he threw the bowl

0	It is full of violence and heart . <s>

0	It happened only 30 years ago
0	but it looks and feels as
0	if it had been much , much longer
0	and yet we 're still dealing with many of the same issues . <s>
0	Gus van sant moves slightly
+	and respectfully to mainstream to tell us this inspiring and tragic story . <s>
+	Sean penn is superb
0	as harvey milk , none of the traits
+	that made him famous are present here , other than his talent
0	that is ,
+	he exudes a positive sweetness
+	that is compelling and contagious . <s>
+	Josh brolin as dan white , manages the impossible
+	by giving the assassin an unexpected but welcome humanity . <s>
+	James franco as milk 's lover is , quite simply , scrumptious . <s>
0	As it happens with most biopics
-	we 're forced to run from event to event
+	to be fair and accurate
-	and " milk " suffers from that . <s>
-	I wanted more insight into diego luna 's character - the most problematic -

+	I was pretty surprised by the quality of this film . <s>
+	As usual , the animation was stunning ,
0	but i digress . <s>
-	What kids ' flick is n't on par with the animation now-a-days , aside maybe the few nobodys
-	that no one ever cares for . <s>
0	Disney and dreamworks are no longer the only real competition . <s>
+	The emotion in the film is definitely its strongest suit ,
0	for you 'll probably find yourself very
+	touched by these characters by the end of the movie . <s>
+	This makes up for the rather simple story actually , one
0	you probably have seen in some cartoon show somewhere . <s>
+	The voice acting was pretty on spot , with steve carell russel brand , and jason segal . <s>
+	And for the record this is probably the only production starring miranda cosgrove
+	that i actually respect . <s>
0	The only other i have to knit pick about is perhaps the score ;
-	not the most stunning i 've ever heard ,
+	but it holds my attention rather well . <s>
